# Basic Tetris Simulator

This is heavily inspired by other people who have likely done it both better and faster :)


### Current Issues:

- Speed down gives segmentation error
    - Skipping trying to assign character out of vector range?
- Can permanently stop falling by causing x-axis collision
    - Needs to fall but still be deleted later
